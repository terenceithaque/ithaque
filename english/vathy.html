        from the sea is a real experience. The narrow pass of the port hides the
        view of the gulf which suddenly reveals its true beauty. The entrance to
        this beautiful natural harbor is guarded by the remains of a of a small
        fort with two cannons. This one is located just above the beach of
        Loutsa and has been beach of Loutsa and was built in 1807, during the
        French occupation of the Ionian Islands. Purified and beautiful, the
        small island of the entrance to the harbor and is a point of reference
        for every Ithacan and visitor. Well maintained and well lit, it hosts
        cultural events of choice and many baptisms and weddings.
